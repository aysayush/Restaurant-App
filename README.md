This app is a single page application purely made with React js. It has an awesome and elegant user interface with all the functionalities that a restaurant app should have.

There is no backend technology used in the app so that's why authentication system (login/logout) is not coded in the app but it has all the front-end requirements completed and forms data has been nicely managed using the state hooks.

Bootstrap has been used for making the app responsive. Additionally, font-awesome icons and some emojis are also used for making the app more attractive and interactive.

The app is neatly breakdown into the folders and components so almost every part of the app is reusable.

Cart system is also fully dynamic and changes the items and their prices in real-time. Context api with the state hook has been used for managing the state globally and also to avoid the props drilling.

A minimal looking 404 page has been also designed and set up for the broken and undefined URLs.

Happy CodingðŸ˜Š <br />
